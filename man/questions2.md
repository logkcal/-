##### 1. Arrays and Strings

1. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?  
2. Implement a function `void reverse(char* str)` in C or C++ which reverses a null-terminated string.  
3. Given two strings, write a method to determine if one is a permutation of the other.
4. Given a string and its actual length, write a method to replace all spaces in a string with `%20`. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters (note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place). e.g.,  
INPUT: "Mr John Smith", and OUTPUT: "Mr%20John%20Smith".
5. Write a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string `aabcccccaaa` would become `a2b1c5a3`. If the 'compressed' string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.
6. Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
7. Implement an algorithm such that if an element in an NxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.
8. Assume you have a method `isSubstring` which checks if a string is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write a method to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring, e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat".

##### 2. Linked Lists

1. Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. What if you cannot use a temporary buffer?
2. Implement an algorithm to find the k-th to last element of a singly linked list.
3. Given access only to a node, implement an algorithm to delete that node in the middle of a singly linked list. e.g.,  
INPUT: node c from a linked list, `a -> b -> c -> d -> e`  
OUTPUT: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like `a -> b -> d -> e`.
4. Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.
5. There are two decimal numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
6. Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns the node at the beginning of the loop. e.g.,  
INPUT: `a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> c`, and OUTPUT: `c`.
7. Implement a method to check if a linked list is a palindrome.

##### 3. Stacks and Queues

1. Implement three stacks using a single array.
2. Design a stack that has a `min` function that returns the minimum element in addition to `push` and `pop`. Push, pop, and min should all operate in O(1) time.
3. Imagine a literal stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack). Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
4. In the classic problem of the towers of Hanoi, you have 3 towers and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom. i.e., each disk sits on top of an even larger one. You have the following constraints:  
   (1) only one disk can be moved a a time.
   (2) a disk is slid off the top of one tower onto the next tower.
   (3) a disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
   Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks.
5. Implement a queue using two stacks.
6. Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order with biggest items on top. You may use additional stacks to hold items, but you may not copy the elements into any other dsta structure such as an array. The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.
7. An animal shelter holds only dogs and cats, and operations on a strictly "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the oldest (based on the arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They cannot select which speicific animal they would like. Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You may use the LinkedList data structure.

##### 4. Trees and Graphs

1. Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.
2. Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.
3. Given a sorted (increasing order) array, implement an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.
4. Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth, e.g., if you have a tree with depth D, you will have D linked lists.
5. Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.
6. Design an algorithm to find the next node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree. You may assume that each node has a link to its parents.
7. Design an algorithm to find the first common ancestor of the nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. Note: this is not necessarily a binary search tree.
8. You have two very large binary trees: T1 with millions of nodes, and T2 with hundreds of nodes. Design an algorithm to decide if T2 is a subtree of T1. A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node in T1 such that the subtree of n is identical to T2. i.e., if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.
9. Given a binary tree in which each node contains a value. Design an algorithm to print all paths which sum to a given value. Note that a path can start or end anywhere in the tree.

##### 5. Bit Operations

1. You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 3, because M couldn't be fully fit beween bit 3 and bit 2. e.g., INPUT: n = 10000000000, m = 10011, i = 2, j = 6, and OUTPUT: n = 10001001100.
2. Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g. 0.72) that is passed in as a double print the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32 characters, print "ERROR".
3. Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation.
4. Explain what the following code does: ((n & (n - 1)) == 0).
5. Write a funciton to determine the number of bits required to convert integer A to integer B. e.g. INPUT: 31, 14, OUTPUT: 2.
6. Write a program to swap odd and event bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible (e.g. bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, and so on).
7. An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except for one number which is missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire integer in A with a single operation. The elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is "fetch the jth bit of A[i]" which takes constant time. Write code to find the missing integer. Can you do it in O(n) time?
8. A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (this is no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen of course can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function drawHorizontalLine(byte[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y) which draws a horizonal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).

4. A bunch of people is living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. There will be a flight out at 8:00 pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else’s eye color, but they do not know his or her own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally, they do not know how many people have blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does. How many days will it take the blue-eyed people to leave?
5. There is a building of 100 floors. If an egg drops from the Nth floor or above, it will break. If it's dropped from any floor below, it will not break. You're given two eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worse case.
6. There are 100 closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening all 100 lockers. Next, he closes every second locker. Then, on his third pass, he toggles every third locker (closes it if it is open or opens it if it is closed). This process continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass i, the man toggles every i-th locker. After his 100th pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker #100, how many lockers are open?

#### 7. Math and Probability

1. You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can ply one of two games. Game 1: You get one shot to make the hoop. Game 2: You get three shoots and you have to make two of three shots.

2. Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager, and director. An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call, he or she must escalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director.

This system has 100 machines to respond to search queries, which may then call out using processSearch(String query) to another cluster of machines to actually get the result. The machine which responds to a given query is chosen at random, so you cannot guarantee that the same machine will always response to the same request. The method processSearch is very expensive. Design a caching mechanism for the most recent queries. Be sure to explain how you would update the cache when data changes.

Implement the data structures and algorithms to support these operations. That is, implement the method track(int x), which is called when each number is generated, and the method getRankOfNumber(int x), which returns the number of values less than or equal to x (not including x itself). e.g.

It automatically counts the number of references to a `SmartPointer<T *>` object and frees the object of type T when the reference count hits zero.
9. Write an aligned malloc and free function that supports allocating memory such that the memory address returned is divisible by a specific power of two. e.g.  
`align_malloc(1000, 128)` will return a memory address that is a multiple of 128 and that points to memory of size 1000 bytes.  
`aligned_free()` will free memory allocated by align_malloc.

1. What's the difference between a thread and a process?
2. How would you measure the time spent in a context switch?
3. In the famous dining philosophers problem, a bunch of philosophers are sitting around a circular table with one chopstick between each of them. A philosopher needs both chopsticks to eat and always picks up the left chopstick before the right one. A deadlock could potentially occur if all the philosophers reached for the left chopstick at the same time. Using threads and locks, implement a simulation of the dining philosophers problem that prevents deadlocks.

`__public void first() { ... }`  
`__public void second() { ... }`  
`__public void third() { ... }`  
`}`

5. The Game of Master Mind is played as follows:  
The computer has four slots, and each slot will contain a ball that is red (R), yellow (Y), green (G), or blue (B). For example, the computer might have RGGB (Slot #1 is red, Slot #2 and #3 are green, Slot #4 is blue).  
When you guess the correct color for the correct slot, you get a "hit". If you guess a color that exits but in the wrong slot, you get a "pseudo-hit". Note that a slot that is a hit can never count as a pseudo-hit. e.g.  
If the actual solution is RGBY and you guess GGRR, you have one hit and one pseudo-hit. Write a method that given a guess and a solution, return the number of hits and pseudo-hits.
6. Given an array of integers, write a method to find indices m and n such that if you sorted elements m through n, the entire array would be sorted. Minimize n - m (that is, find the smallest such sequence). e.g.  
INPUT: 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 7, 12, 6, 7, 16, 18, 19  
OUTPUT: 3, 9
7. Given any integer, print an English phrase that describes the integer (e.g. "One Thousand. Two Hundred Thirty Four").
8. You are given an array of integers (both positive and negative). Find the contiguous sequences with the largest sum. Return the sum. e.g.  
INPUT: 2, -8, 3, -2, 4, -10  
OUTPUT: 5 (or, 3, -2, 4)
9. Design a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given word in a book.
10. Since XML is very verbose, you are given a way of encoding it where each tag gets mapped to a pre-defined integer value. The language/grammar is as follows:  
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Element</td>
      <td>Tag Attributes END Children END</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Attribute</td>
      <td>Tag Value</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>END</td>
      <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tag</td>
      <td>some predefined mapping to int</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value</td>
      <td>string value END</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
e.g. the following XML might be converted into the compressed string below (assuming a mapping of family -> 1, person -> 2, firstname -> 3, lastName -> 4, state -> 5).  
`<family lastName="McDowell" state="CA">`  
`__<person firstName="Gayle">Some Message</person>`  
`</family>`  
becomes:  
`1 4 McDowell 5 CA 0 2 3 Gayle 0 Some Message 0 0`.  
Write code to print the encoded version of an XML element (passed in Element and Attribute objects).
11. Implement a method rand7() given rand5(). Given a method that generates a random number between 1 and 5 (inclusive), write a method that generates a random number between 1 and 7 (inclusive).
12. Design an algorithm to find all pairs of integers within an array which sum to a specified value.
13. Consider a simple node-like data structure called BiNode, which has pointers to two other nodes.  
`public class BiNode {`  
`__public BiNode node1, node2`  
`__public int data`  
`}`  
The data structure BiNode could be used to represent both a binary tree (where node1 is the left node and node2 is the right node), or a doubly linked list (where node 1 is the previous node and node2 is the next node). Implement a method to convert a binary search tree (implemented with BiNode) into a doubly linked list. The values should be kept in order and the operation should be performed is place (this is on the original data structure).
14. Oh, no! You have just completed a lengthy document when you have an unfortunate Find/Replace mishap. You have accidently removed all spaces, punctuation, and capitalization in the document. A sentence like "I reset the computer. It still didn't boot!" would become "iresetthecomputeritstillldidntboot". You figure that you can add back in the punctuation and capitalization later, once you get the individual words properly separated. Most of the words will be in a dictionary, but some strings, like proper names, will not.  
Given a dictionary (a list of words) design an algorithm to find the optimal way of un-concatenating a sequence of words. In this case, "optimal" is defined to be the parsing which minimizes the number of unrecognized sequences of characters. e.g.  
the string "jesslookedjustliketimherbrother" would be optimally parsed as "JESS looked just like TIM her brother". This parsing has seven unrecognized characters, which we have capitalized for clarity.

#### 18. Hard Problems

1. Write a function that adds two numbers. You should not use + or any arithmetic operators.
2. Write a method to shuffle a deck of cards. It must be a perfect shuffle -- in other words, each of the 52! permutations of the deck has to be equally likely. Assume that you are given a random number generator which is perfect.
3. Write a method to randomly generate a set of m integers from an array of size n. Each element must have equal probability of being chosen.
4. Write a method to count the number of 2s that appear in all the numbers between 0 and n (inclusive). e.g.  
INPUT: 25  
OUTPUT: 9 (2, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. Note that 22 counts for two 2s)
5. You have a large text file containing words. Given any two words, find the shortest distance (in terms of number of words) between them in the file. Can you make the searching operation in O(1) time? What about the space complexity for your solution?
6. Describe an algorithm to find the smallest one million numbers in one billion numbers. Assume that the computer memory can hold all one billion numbers.
7. Given a list of words, write a program to find the longest word made of other words in the list. e.g.  
INPUT: car, banana, dog, nana, walk, walker, dogwalker  
OUTPUT: dogwalker
8. Given a string s and an array of smaller strings T, design a method to search s for each small string in T.
9. Numbers are randomly generated and passed to a method. Write a program to find and maintain the median value as new values are generated.
10. Given two words of equal length that are in a dictionary, write a method to transform one word into another word by changing only one letter at a time. The new word you get in each step must be in the dictionary. e.g.  
INPUT: DAMP, LIKE  
OUTPUT: DAMP -> LAMP -> LIMP -> LIME -> LIKE
11. Imagine you have a square matrix, where each cell (pixel) is either black or white. Design an algorithm to find the maximum subsquare such that all four borders are filled with black pixels.
12. Given an NxN matrix of positive and negatives integers, write code to find the submatrix with the largest possible sum.
13. Given a list of millions of words, design an algorithm to create the largest possible rectangle of letters such that every row forms a word (reading left to right) and every column forms a word (reading top to bottom). The words need not be chosen consecutively from the list, but all rows must be the same length and all columns must be the same height.
